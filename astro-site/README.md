# Abongo Astro Site

This folder contains an Astro + React setup using Tailwind CSS v4.

The page is composed of reusable React components (Hero, Mission, Impact)
and uses images placed in the `public` folder.

To get started after cloning the repository:

```bash
cd astro-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Astro development server. The existing `index.html` file at the project root has been preserved as a reference.
